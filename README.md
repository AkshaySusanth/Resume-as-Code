# Resume-as-Code 

![Workflow Status](https://github.com/AkshaySusanth/Resume-as-Code/actions/workflows/resume-as-code.yml/badge.svg)

**Resume-as-Code** is a GitHub repository that transforms resume management into an automated, code-driven process. This project leverages GitHub Actions to ensure that the resume is always up-to-date and available in the repository.

The repository contains a `resume-as-code.tex` file, which serves as the source for the resume. Every commit to this file triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically generates a PDF version, ensuring the resume remains up-to-date with every change.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automated Compilation**: Automatically compiles `.tex` files into a PDF whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
- **Artifact Storage**: Stores the compiled PDF as an artifact for download.
- **Version Control**: Commits and pushes the compiled PDF back to the repository for seamless version tracking.
