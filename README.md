# Resume-as-Code
Resume-as-Code is a GitHub repository that transforms resume management into an automated, code-driven process. It stores a resume.tex file, and every commit to this file triggers a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically generate a PDF version, ensuring the resume stays up-to-date with every change.
